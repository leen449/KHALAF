🏛️ Khalaf | Saudi Heritage Explorer
Transforming Saudi history from static facts into lived experiences.

Khalaf is a digital startup dedicated to bridging the gap between Saudi Arabia’s rich cultural past and the modern digital world. Traditional history is often presented in a way that feels distant or unengaging; Khalaf solves this by using visual storytelling, cinematic design, and personal narratives to make heritage accessible and emotionally resonant for everyone—from curious locals to global explorers.
